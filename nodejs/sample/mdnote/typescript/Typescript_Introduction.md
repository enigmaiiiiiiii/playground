# Introduction

## what problem does typescript solve

- JavaScript is hard to predict what code will do **before it runs**
- Spell check

## what static type language should be

- type is concept of describing which values can be passed to and which will crash
- static type has to make the call over what code should be **flagged as an error**

## complile typescript

- typescript aren't part of JavaScript(or ECMAScript to be pedantic)
- so there aren't any browsers or other runtimes that can just run TypeScript unmodified
- type annotations are completely erased during compilation

## what typescript does

- 提供类型检查的同时, 提供了[更严格的检查等级](typescript-config-file.md), 等级越高typescript检查的越多
